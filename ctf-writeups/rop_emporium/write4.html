    <p>
    	This challenge gives us a binary to download and develop the exploit for locally.
        <br>
    	This binary is quite similar to the split challenge. It once again has a win function that opens and prints out a file for us, however in this case the name of the file is nowhere to be found in memory. This means that we need to manually write the string "flag.txt" into memory and pass it to the function if we want to retrieve the flag.
        <br>
        We start off by confirming where we want to write our string to. In this case I chose the bss section since it is non randomized, and has rw- permission, which means that we can write to the section without causing the binary to crash. The address of this section can be found in pwndbg using the command 'maintenance info sections'.

        Now that we know where we want to write to, we need to figure out how exactly we want to accomplish this task. Using ropper we find three gadgets that we can use to accomplish exactly this. Using the 2 pop gadgets we can set up the rdi & rsi registers. Since we now have control over the rdi and rsi registers, we can use them to write any data of our choice to any location in memory that we chose.

        We now have everything we need to craft our exploit. First we write the string "flag.txt" into memory in the bss section. This has to be done in 2 phases since we can only copy over 4 bytes at a time since our gadget uses edi instead of rdi. We can now call the win function with our "flag.txt" string as an argument.
        <br>
        Running this exploit prints out the flag. Below you can find our complete commented exploit script.
