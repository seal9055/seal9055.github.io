    	<br><br>
    	This challenge gives us a binary to download and develop the exploit for locally, and then an address to connect to and retrieve the flag from using the developed exploit.
        <br>
    	We start off by running Ghidra on the binary to view the disassembly and get an idea as to what's going on.

        This challenge appears to be almost the exact same as Binary Gauntlet 2. Once again we have a format string vulnerability to leak out an address of the stack, and can then overflow the buffer and point the return address to the leaked address. The only difference this time however is that as the problem mentions, the stack is no longer executable. So we will not be able to work with shellcode anymore, and need to spawn a shell through different manners. We can verify the existence of nx using checksec.

        Testing different inputs similarly to how we did for Binary Gauntlet 0, we see a couple of different values.

        After testing out the values that look like they might be a libc address, we find success with 0x7ffff7de50b3. This is the address of __libc_start_main+243. When we now calculate its offset from the libc base, and subtract another 243 off of it, we find a fitting libc for the binary on libc.rip. We download the first listed libc to start working on our exploit.
