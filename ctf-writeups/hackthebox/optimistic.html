    	This challenge gives us a binary to download and develop the exploit for locally, and then an address to connect to remotely and retrieve the flag from using the developed exploit.
        <br>
    	The provided binary is fairly short. If we enter 'y' at the first prompt to continue with execution, it starts off by asking us for our email and age. Both of these are completely irrelevant. Next it asks us for the length of our name, and then it executes 'read(stdin,stack_var,name_length);' using the provided length as an argument. This is an obvious overflow bug, however there is still one small obstacle. A check is done to make sure that our provided length is less than 65. If it is higher it exits. Providing a length lower than 65 does not benefit us, since that is not a big enough read to overflow the return address. Luckily for us however, the length is treated as a signed integer, so if we provide a negative number, the check will pass, but read will still allow us to read in a large amount of bytes and overflow.

        Now that we have our overflow bug we need to figure out how to exploit it. The binary kindly gives us a stack leak, and checking the protections reveals that it is compiled without nx enabled. This means that the challenge authors intention for this challenge was to make us write shellcode onto the stack, and then redirect execution to it.

        At this point there was just one more hurdle to overcome. The author added a loop that iterates through our input and checks if all characters excluding the last 9 are alphanumeric.

        I played around with writing custom shellcode for this challenge for a bit, but as it turns out, a lot of the opcodes do not fall in this range, even when trying out alternative ways to achieve an instruction (e.g. "push 0; pop rax"   vs   "xor rax, rax"), so I would have had to encrypt my payload and write a decrypt stub. Since I do not particularly enjoy writing odd shellcode that I will probably never need again, I instead searched for an Alphanumeric shellcode online and found this: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35205. <br> This shellcode ended up working as expected, and allowed us to retrieve the flag. 
        <br><br>
        The full exploit is posted below.
