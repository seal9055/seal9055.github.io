    <p>I am currently a sophomore computer science major at the University
        of Massachusetts Amherst. I recently achieved my oscp certification,
        and would now like to focus on training my skills through various CTF's.

    <p>Due to this I decided to create this page to have a platform
        on which I can publish various posts such as CTF and Hackthebox writeups.
