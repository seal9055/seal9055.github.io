        I am currently an undergrad senior computer science major at UMass Amherst. I got the oscp
        certification 01/2021, and have been studying low level security ever since. My main
        interests lie in binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and systems development in the
        realm of fuzzers, operating systems and hypervisors. I frequently participate in CTF's with
        K3RN3L4RMY.
