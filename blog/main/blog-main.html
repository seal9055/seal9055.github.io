                I recently decided that I wanted to start learning a bit about game hacking to become a better reverse engineer, and figured, what better target than the classic minesweeper game? This is the first game I ever reversed, so my process was definitely not the most efficient, but after about 5 hours I accomplished the 2 goals I set for myself when starting this:<br>
                1. Guaranteed Win - I accomplished this by patching the binary to call the terminating function with arguments that result in a win upon hitting a bomb
                <br>
                2. Print out all bombs at game start - This was a bit more difficult. I had to create a code cave, and redirect execution to it to call a function that prints out the bombs right at the beginning before continuing execution without hangups.
