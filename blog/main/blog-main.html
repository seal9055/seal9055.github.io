                This will be the first post in a series focused on writing a linux character device driver. This post covers the basics of initializing a driver and implementing simple open/release/read/write functions. Kernel modules are used to extend the kernel's functionality to support different devices and non-standard operations. This series will assume no prerequisite knowledge and cover the creation of a linux kernel module starting from the very beginning.

                I recently decided that I wanted to start learning a bit about game hacking to become a better reverse engineer, and figured, what better target than the classic minesweeper game? This is the first game I ever reversed, so my process was definitely not the most efficient, but after about 5 hours I accomplished the 2 goals I set for myself when starting this:<br><br>
                1. Guaranteed Win<br>
                2. Print out all bombs at game start
